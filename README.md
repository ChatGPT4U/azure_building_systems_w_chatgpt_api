## Introduction

This section will be updated soon.

## Language Models, the Chat Format and Tokens

### `1\azure_openai_responses.py`

This script demonstrates how to use the OpenAI API to generate responses to a set of prompts. The API settings are securely loaded from environment variables.

### `1\azure_openai_token_counter.py`

This script showcases how to use the OpenAI API to generate chat responses and count tokens in different scenarios, providing insights into the token usage of your API calls.

## Classification

### `2\customer_service_query_classifier.py`

This script implements a customer service chatbot using the OpenAI API. It classifies user queries into categories and generates appropriate responses based on these classifications.

## Moderation

### `3\openai_moderation.py`

This script provides a simple example of how to use OpenAI's Moderation API to moderate a list of text strings, ensuring the content is appropriate and adheres to community guidelines.
